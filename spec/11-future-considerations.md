# 11 Future Considerations

11.1 Integration with a blockchain solution to guarantee the integrity of data and logs from unauthorized changes. This option may be available with a fee therefore should be optional.

11.2 Data storage federation (for example as a block chain)\
Cloud storage federation model provides the integration of multiple cloud storage providers into a single virtual storage pool, eliminating the dependency on a single provider and decreasing vendor lock-in problem. Moreover, federating multiple cloud storage providers improve data availability, storage scalability and data processing performance.

11.3 Installation automation requirements- system installation could be done with full automation in a local server or in a cloud.

11.4 Integrations with Electronic signature solutions to give a consent as an applicant or a confirmation as a registrar.

11.5 The registration information may be read out aloud and displayed on screen to the applicant as the operator is entering registration data. Done, see req. SF-11.

11.6 AI supported automated registrations and decisions.

11.7 Integration with chatbot and knowledge base to support users in their walkthrough in the service.

11.8 SMS and/or voice/natural language e-services as Plug and play BB components should be described.

11.9 Open data component to share all data that is anonymized. Publish appropriate (i.e. anonymised) Open Data automatically on registration applications, and regularly (e.g. monthly) pseudonymised aggregate data.

The Open API endpoint mapping must be solved by this BB in order to fulfill the requirement to pull data to the form and to send the data to external endpoints. SF-7 is the only requirement, The rest of the functionality to achieve this must be done by the BB developers. And as the communication is done via Information Mediator, (Pre-requirement) the authorization details are already configured for the Open API endpoints(See Information Mediator BB). Will be added to the specification: Open API endpoint URL defining and API request/response mapping functionality.                       |

Will be discussed where to add.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Specification on encryption for data storage - How will the business user specify which fields need to be encrypted?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Will be added in the V2. The business user/analyst can configure the captured data properties and decide the need for encryption in rest state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
